# ghpy
Control github from your terminal.
GHPY - Github Python
`ghpy` is a terminal utility based on the original one [gh](https://github.com/victorgama/gh) made in Go that allow you to use Github directly from your terminal. I'm creating this Python implementation as a challenge to myself. **Disclaimer**: It's still a work in progress.
